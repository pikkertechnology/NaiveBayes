# Naive Bayes

This is a Naive Bayes classifier model written in rust that reads the text from a file. This project is part of [study material sharing website](https://openabi.ee) where it is used for classifying different categories of uploaded material.    

## How it works

The model has 2 endpoints: **train** and **predict**

We use endpoints so that the model can be used in a *docker container*.
